\subsection{End-user study}


The 'Networked Only' checkbox caused some confusion, as one user assumed it was a filter which should instantly be reflected on the results as one checks or unchecks it. Although not originally intended as an auto-updating filter (actual filters were not implemented) the behaviour of the checkbox was altered, by adding an \texttt{onchange} event which submits the form every time it is checked or unchecked. This results in an experience that is more aligned with the user's expectations, and is a reasonable compromise until a proper filtering system is put in place.
