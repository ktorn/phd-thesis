\section{Cost of Storage}

Currently, the cost of minting an OBJKT on the HEN contract constitutes a fraction of the cost of hosting and/or pinning 2GB of data. This represents a loophole that could be exploited by malicious actors, or freeloaders, making the pinning of assets hosted by Teia unfeasible without a significant recurring investment, which impacts the economic sustainability of the project.

\section{Emulation}

As time passes, technology will continue to evolve. New hardware will run new operating systems, which will run new web browsers, or even totally paradigm changing \emph{content rendering applications} which may replace web browsers in the future. This means that in long term it seems inevitable that all code-base artworks created today, even those based on web standards and without any network dependencies, will require some form of hardware and/or browser emulation to render successfully. 

This inevitable evolution into emulated environments does represent an additional challenge for networked artworks, because in addition to emulating the artefact's code-base itself, the emulation environment must also simulate the network dependencies of the artwork, and this can pose a problem known to software developers as \emph{dependency hell}, where each dependency in turn depends on a number of other dependencies, leading to an ever increasing dependency tree. A solution to this problem seems unfeasible, if any of those dependencies, or their sub-dependencies, does not strictly follow the web3 architecture that makes projects easily duplicable.

For this reason, the IOC model gains an even greater importance for the longevity of code-based networked artworks, because you can more easily generate the data expected by the artwork, or in the worst-case scenario, simply repeatedly inject the last known good snapshot of data for all future renderings.
