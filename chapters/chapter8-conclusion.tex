\section{Future Work}


An idea is to work out a standard "introduction to smart contracts" academic programme, that is both agnostic of underlying platform but introduces students to the pros and cons of each existing platform.

\subsection{Support for WACZ file export}

The choice not to pursue webrecorder snapshots for this work was purely pragmatic, given the issues in making the programatic snapshots work and the time constraints of the project. However it would be beneficial for Arkivo snapshots to be exportable as WACZ files, as it is a well established standard which would add value to the data recorded by Arkivo. Therefore support for WACZ snapshots/exports has been added to the short-term roadmap for Arkivo.
