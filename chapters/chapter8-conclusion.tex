\section{Future Work}


An idea is to work out a standard "introduction to smart contracts" academic programme, that is both agnostic of underlying platform but introduces students to the pros and cons of each existing platform.

\subsection{Personal Curation Logs}

mention fxhash articles (https://docs.fxhash.xyz/articles) and their tezos pointer scheme (https://github.com/fxhash/specifications/blob/main/general/tezos-storage-pointers.md) which may be useful for the idea of cross contract references, which is my plan for documentation (each person, one contract, cross-referecning OBJKTs)

\subsection{Support for WACZ file export}

The choice not to pursue webrecorder snapshots for this work was purely pragmatic, given the issues in making the programatic snapshots work and the time constraints of the project. However it would be beneficial for Arkivo snapshots to be exportable as WACZ files, as it is a well established standard which would add value to the data recorded by Arkivo. Therefore support for WACZ snapshots/exports has been added to the short-term roadmap for Arkivo.
