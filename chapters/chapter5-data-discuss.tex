\chapter{Artifact Evaluation and Discussion}

In this chapter we will evaluate the artifact from three perspectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic web performance metrics;
    \item A systematic collection and analysis of the data produced by the artifact;
    \item Interviews with stakeholders;
\end{enumerate}


\section{Web Performance Metrics}

Using a website speed tester, we can gather useful information about the performance of the artifact, in terms of loading latency. For this test, Pingdom\footnotemark[1] was used.

\footnotetext[1]{https://tools.pingdom.com/}

Three tests were carried out, one for each of the page types:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The about page;
    \item The artifacts browsing page;
    \item The artifact detail page;
\end{enumerate}

All tests were carried out from Pingdom's North America - USA - Washington DC location.

\subsection{Web Performance Analysis}

The overall performance in terms of latency is good, although there is room for improvement. The initial page load still spends a significant amount of time in the \texttt{wait} stage, expire headers are needed, and gzip compression should also be added. Having said that, the assets loaded from the IPFS node performed better than expected.


\section{IPFS Pinning Verification}

One important outcome from developing and launching this artifact, was that it would contribute to the storage and availability of the assets from the artworks which it catalogues, by pinning their CIDs on the IPFS network. To verify that this is the case, one can use online tools which test and report whether a node does indeed do this, such as the IPFS Check tool by Fleek\footnotemark[2].

\footnotetext[2]{https://ipfs-check.on.fleek.co/}

Before doing this we need to gather some information, namely our IPFS node PeerID, and the CID of an artwork's asset that we want to test.

For the IPFS node PeerID, we need to gain shell access to the docker container:

\texttt{docker exec -it arkivo\_ipfs /bin/sh}

And then run the command:

\texttt{ipfs id}

This returns a listing as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={IPFS ID Listing}, label={lst:ipfs-id}]

\end{lstlisting}

Our IPFS node ID, which was automatically generated the first time we started the node, appears in line 2:
\begin{center}
\texttt{12D3KooWLgNwdHQspFbSSTPSGzarCLL9iQZ4byGfaTpMNfHqBxsA}
\end{center}
For a CID to test with, we can access an artwork on the system, such as\\ \texttt{https://arkivo.art/artifacts/HEN/8333}, expand the Artifact URIs section, and click the Artifact URI, which opens the artifact's URI on a new window.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption[Finding Artwork IPFS CID (part 1)]{Finding Artwork IPFS CID (part 1)}
    \label{fig:find-cid-1}
\end{figure}

The actual IPFS CID appears on the URL, between \texttt{ipfs/} and \texttt{?creator}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{how-to-find-cid2.png}
    \caption[Finding Artwork IPFS CID (part 2)]{Finding Artwork IPFS CID (part 2)}
    \label{fig:find-cid-1}
\end{figure}

In this example, the CID is:
\begin{center}
\texttt{QmaBAtgp6CKJwW6R4xKpNdcmjuzF132erhKExqo4wh6FCV}
\end{center}

With the \texttt{Peer ID} and the artwork's artifact CID, we can access the Fleek IPFS Check tool, and start the check. Making sure to prefix our Peer ID with \texttt{/p2p/}:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fleek-ipfs-check.png}
    \caption[Testing IPFS]{Testing IPFS}
    \label{fig:fleek-test}
\end{figure}

As can be verified in \autoref{fig:fleek-test} our node is accessible on the IPFS network, reports that it has the CID, and is also advertising its availability on the networks DHT, making it easier for other nodes to find it.

An additional check we can make is from an independent IPFS node. For example, using the IPFS node in the development server which is located in Macau, we can run a command to find IPFS nodes which are seeding a CID:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={Verification of CID availability from external node}, label={lst:ipfs-verify-macau}]

12D3KooWGtYkBAaqJMJEmywMxaCiNP7LCEFUAFiLEBASe232c2VH
\end{lstlisting}

As can be seen in \autoref{lst:ipfs-verify-macau}, line 3 shows \texttt{ARKIVO}'s IPFS node. It should be noted that seeding peers are not all necessarily pinning the CID. It is simply an indication that those peers currently have a copy of the CID and are making it available to the network, but for some it could be a temporary cache and the CID could be garbage collected by those nodes at any point.

Something else worth noting is that sometimes, even when pinning content, the results from the IPFS check tool may return a failed check relating to multiash missing from the DHT, see \autoref{fig:fleek-test2}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fleek-ipfs-check2.png}
    \caption[Testing IPFS (No DHT)]{Testing IPFS (No DHT)}
    \label{fig:fleek-test2}
\end{figure}

This is normal, and it is due to the fact that, by default, IPFS nodes only advertise their content every 22h \cite{KuboConfigFile2024}, and it may expire from the DHT. Normally this is not a problem, since other nodes, even those not pinning the CIDs, will likely be making them available to the network. There are tradeoffs for increasing the frequency of these provisioning messages, and normally it is a matter of hardware resources. For now we will keep the default value of 22h.


\subsection{Exhaustive IPFS Pin List Verification}

The above checks provide a very basic verification that the system is pinning content, but checking a single CID or even a handful of CIDs manually hardly constitutes a systematic evaluation of the artifact.
Therefore another method was employed, which does an exhaustive check, of every CID stored in the system's database.
The process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item export every unique CID from the artifacts stored in the postgres database
    \item export every CID pinned by the ipfs node
    \item cross check the two data sets to find any discrepancies, such as CIDs present in one dataset but missing from the other
\end{enumerate}

Step 1, involves running the following SQL query:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption={SQL to export all IPFS CIDs store in DB}, label={lst:db-export-cids}] 
SELECT DISTINCT cid AS unique_cid_count
FROM (
    SELECT metadata_uri AS cid FROM artifacts
    UNION ALL
    SELECT artifact_uri AS cid FROM artifacts
    UNION ALL
    SELECT display_uri AS cid FROM artifacts
    UNION ALL
    SELECT thumbnail_uri AS cid FROM artifacts
) AS combined_cids;
\end{lstlisting}

The database exported dataset contained 47,493 records and was saved as \texttt{arkivo-db-cids.txt}. A partial listing of the file is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={Exported CIDs from postgres}, label={lst:db-export-cids-list}] 
ipfs://QmSbeMcatTg86Yjdva2RW7cQDSZtZWGpCbTMMaYNv44kuA
ipfs://QmV6G8cwEbQ1AGeQjCNDNj1kRZq4UBmmRsZi9yRr594vSh
ipfs://QmThtdTz2LD1u8uoP1zV9qtrfShcm1WSBVXHNfLTLZwHPD
ipfs://QmZuBNwDxegm6RFsU7KRxxkqy6G1y2oHiotnZqFPnMFUQx
ipfs://QmRuTHQAC3naGCxxPTCTrnrb1oXEbANhNwUwyUsaCwbhfB
...
\end{lstlisting}

Step 2, requires that we export a similar dataset from the IPFS node:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={IPFS command to export pinned CIDs}, label={lst:ipfs-export-cids}] 
ipfs pin ls --type=recursive > ipfs-node-pins.txt
\end{lstlisting}

The ipfs node exported dataset contained 46,942 records and was saved as \texttt{arkivo-db-cids.txt}. A partial listing of the file is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={Exported CIDs from IPFS node}, label={lst:ipfs-export-cids-list}] 
QmRQYgQGFjNJBudPnVEwA3jzBKaDWna943DCdCamdphdJU recursive

QmauH5zh1UZjWoFKxQ33MW8YuepvUnUsUqzqoB3Scy6tvq recursive
...
\end{lstlisting}

There is a discrepancy of 47,493 - 46,942 = 551 records which needs to be investigated.

To perform a full cross-check between the two datasets a python program\footnotemark[3] was written that automates this process. The program ingests both files, compares them, and outputs 3 files:

\footnotetext[3]{https://github.com/seda-studio/arkivo/blob/main/utils/ipfs-pin-verification/compare-tool.py}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{output-arkivo-cids-ok.txt} - all CIDs which are present in both datasets. These are the CIDs which are properly pinned.
    \item \texttt{output-arkivo-cids-unpinned.txt} - all CIDs present in the database file, but not pinned by the IPFS node. Any records here would be of concern.
    \item \texttt{output-ipfs-node-unknown.txt} - all CIDS pinned by the IPFS node but not in the database file. Any records here would be odd, and deserved investigation.
\end{enumerate}

After running the python script the results were as follows:


\begin{table}[h]
\footnotesize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
\hline
\textbf{File} & \textbf{Total CIDs} \\ \hline
output-arkivo-cids-ok.txt                 & 46,924                         \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{IPFS CID Pinning Cross Check Results}
\label{table:cross-check-results}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Analysis of Unpinned CIDs}

A preliminary visual examination of \texttt{output-arkivo-cids-unpinned.txt} reveals a vast majority of unconventionally formatted entries, or even entries which are not CIDs at all. These correspond to OBJKTs which were not minted via the HEN or Teia UIs, but rather used custom minters or were just minted manually by interacting directly with the HEN smart contract, which anyone can do as the smart contract does not restrict who can interact with it.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={Unconventional Format CIDs}, label={lst:bad cids}]

...
\end{lstlisting}

One type of record consists of CIDs followed by a URL query, such `?seed=`. These are custom generative artworks which take a URL parameter as seed. The artist sets up their own website where collectors were able to input their own text as a seed to the artwork, visualise the result, and then collect that iteration as a permanently minted HEN OBJKT.

After manual analysis of the file, 4 instances of this kind of CID were found:

\end{tabular}
\caption{Custom Generative Art CIDs}
\label{table:custom-generative-cids}

These 4 CIDs are all from the same artist account\footnotemark[4], which belongs to generative artist @shig\_nft\footnotemark[5] , who created a series of these projects, under the name ``Procedural Symbols''. A couple of samples of the artwork are included here:

  \caption{Sample ``Procedural Symbols'', which add URL queries to IPFS CIDs}
  \label{fig:procedural-symbols}
\end{figure}

However the artist was also careful to mint each of the above CIDs as well formatted CID, without the URL query. This means both HEN, Teia, and now \texttt{ARKIVO} successfully pin them, and therefore those 552 records can be safely ignored as they will all work, as verified by the artworks illustrated in \autoref{fig:procedural-symbols}.

We are therefore left with 17 CIDs unaccounted for:

After checking each one, 15 were found to be failed tests, as artists were experimenting with the possibilities. Most belong to OBJKTs which have been burned by the artists. However 2 CIDs were found to be valid and belong to existing artworks indexed by our artifact.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={17 Remaining Unconventional Format CIDs}, label={lst:17-bad-cids}] 
QmU7kxXjA8mXRNEZi21joc62fCdYMgVDnErYCYr3EyH4sJ
QmVQwyh9hNJVPzUmnTYFqY6bvX6PGUGxEyF1w45M9R1Brn 
\end{lstlisting}

Both are thumbnails, belonging to OBJKTs 767305 and 796127, respectively. It is unclear why these 2 CIDs, out of a total 46,924 CIDs, failed to get pinned. The ipfs pinning worker, similarly to the snapshot worker, will re-try an operation 3 times, as per the configuration of the redis queue. However these retries are immediate, and not delayed, so a temporary network issue, or some other problem could have affected these.

Nevertheless, one of the CLI management commands that we developed allow us to issue a pin request for any OBJKT. The syntax for the command is:\\
{
\footnotesize{\texttt{node ace artifacts:pin <blockchain> <smart-contract-address> <token-id>}}\\
}


This command will attempt a pin (or re-pin) of all CIDs associated with an OBJKT: metadata, artifact, display, and thumbnail.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={Command to Pin OBJKT}, label={lst:17-bad-cids}]

\end{lstlisting}

To verify that the command worked, we tried to access the URLs from our IPFS node before and after running it.

  \label{fig:2-repinned-cids}

With this, we can now conclude that all valid CIDs are successfully pinned by our IPFS node. However we still have 18 CIDs pinned by the IPFS node which are not in our database, therefore unaccounted for.


\subsubsection{Analysis of Unknown CIDs}

The list of 18 unknown CIDs is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={Command to Pin OBJKT}, label={lst:18-unknown-cids}] 
QmVi33nTqwUZbL64d7Ab9EPPW4npmQRxMhE1E8VQnQZsHf

\end{lstlisting}

Two of the CIDs were done manually as a means to test the IPFS node, so are accounted for. However the 16 remaining ones are unknown, and the vast majority seem to be trailers for a Chinese TV soap opera.
The most plausible theory is that, during the deployment of the artifact in production, a few hours elapsed in which the firewall was not yet in place, and remote nodes were able to access our node's private API port (5001) and remotely requested the pinning of those CIDs.

Since we already have the firewall in place now, it is just a matter of cleaning those CIDs from our node, which we did with the command: \texttt{ipfs pin rm <CID>}, followed by a \texttt{ipfs repo gc} to garbage collect any remains of CIDs which should not be there.

Additionally, we enabled the option \texttt{NoFetch = true} on the IPFS node configuration, which ensures our node only serves content which is explicitly pinned, and will not attempt to fetch any other CIDs requested via the public gateway. Only requests from our application, via the (now private) API port will pin new content to our node.

This was an invaluable, as well as slightly comical, lesson and reminder on how to deploy IPFS nodes, or any other application for that matter: have the firewall in place \emph{before} deployment!

\subsection{Verifying IPFS Data Integrity}

Verifying that all CIDs are pinned is only half of the work. We also need to check the data integrity of all pinned content on the node. To achieve that, IPFS offers a command which exhaustively checks the data integrity of every pinned CID: \texttt{ipfs pin verify}. This command can take some time to complete, with over 46000 CIDs to verify, for that reason the command was prefixed by \texttt{time} to determine how long it takes to execute.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=, caption={Internal IPFS pin verification}, label={lst:ipfs-pin-verification}] 
/ # time ipfs pin verify
real	5m 30.82s
user	0m 0.07s
sys	  0m 0.05s
\end{lstlisting}

As can be seen in \autoref{lst:ipfs-pin-verification}, it ran in 5m30s and returned no errors, therefore our storage's integrity is verified.


\section{Snapshot Verification}

Verifying the validity of the snapshots is significantly more difficult, because many things could go wrong unnoticed, for example a screenshot could fail to capture the rendering of the artwork.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify that every artifact has one, and only one, snapshot recorded in the database;
    \item Perform a systematic visual check of the screenshots
    \item Perform a manual verification that the classification of artworks as networked is correct
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Snapshot Record Integrity Verification}

Here we want to run a SQL query that verifies that each artifact in the database has exactly one snapshot. 

The first query we run checks if any artifacts do not have a snapshot:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption={SQL - Check Missing Snapshots}, label={lst:sql-missing-snapshots}] 
SELECT COUNT(id)
FROM artifacts
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT artifact_id
    FROM snapshots
);
\end{lstlisting}

And unfortunately we have a total of \texttt{174}. Similarly to the IPFS pinning worker, our snapshoting worker retries 3 times before giving up, so something wrong must be happening with these artifacts.

After exporting the list of token\_ids affected,  another batch of snapshots was started, just for those artifacts. It became clear that something is indeed preventing these artifacts from getting snapshotted, with Playwright reporting several timeout errors. A visual inspection of a selection of the artifacts proved that it was loading on the web UI, so the IFPS asset was present in the system. One observation was that all these artifacts were quite \emph{heavy} in terms of CPU load, making the fan on the computer spin up. This could be an indication of the problem. After the batch of snapshots completed, the SQL query was retried and this time the number went down to \texttt{164}. This means 10 artifacts out of 174, succeeded in getting snapshotted this time around.

Since we are indexing and hosting 21,390 artifacts, 164 represents only 0.766\% of the total, so it was decided that the snapshots for these artifacts would have to be revisited at a later stage.

The reverse query was then used to find artifacts that may have more than one snapshot.


\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption={SQL - Check Duplicate Snapshots}, label={lst:sql-missing-snapshots}] 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT artifact_id, COUNT(*) AS snapshot_count
    FROM snapshots
    GROUP BY artifact_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
) AS subquery;
\end{lstlisting}

This returned a surprising count of \texttt{4345}. A quick follow-up query revealed 13 artifacts with 3 snapshots each, followed by a long tail of artifacts with 2 snapshots. This represents nearly 20\% of all artifacts having more than one snapshot. Since only one batch of snapshots was run, this could mean that there is an issue on the snapshot retry logic. A note was taken of this for future troubleshooting, and the duplicate snapshots were removed:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption={SQL - Deleting Duplicate Snapshots}, label={lst:sql-missing-snapshots}] 
DELETE FROM snapshots
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT id FROM (
        SELECT id,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY artifact_id ORDER BY created_at DESC) AS rn
        FROM snapshots
    ) AS ranked
    WHERE rn = 1
);
\end{lstlisting}

This concluded the basic snapshot record integrity check. Now we need to look into the actual content of the snapshots.

\subsection{Snapshot Visual Verification}

At a first glance the snapshot seems to have identified the external network call, and ignored the internal ones. It also captured the screenshot well.
The full snapshot download worked as well. To verify that the network call was well identified it was run with the browser's developer tools open. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{snapshot-sample.png}
    \caption[Sample Snapshot]{Sample Snapshot}
    \label{fig:sample-snapshot}
\end{figure}

Additionally, the automatic classification was checked for correctness. It also passed, see \autoref{ig:sample-classfication}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sample-classification.png}
    \caption[Sample Classification]{Sample Classification}
    \label{fig:sample-classfication}
\end{figure}


After this initial check a systematic verification took place. For every 50 pages of results, the first artifact on the page was checked following the same procedure as above. A total of 36 artifacts were manually verified and all passed the test.

At this stage we were ready to involve stakeholders in the evaluation of the artifact.


\section{Stakeholder Feedback}

Several stakeholders were contacted, via twitter and discord, however due to lack of time, only six participated. Three via a written evaluation form, and three agreed to be interviewed remotely via Discord and Google Meet.

\subsection{Evaluation Form}

The goal of the evaluation form was to help validate the classification capabilities of the artifact, as well as gather feedback about potential areas of improvement. The evaluation form can be found in Appendix 4, page \pageref{chap:evalform}.

All three participants knew networked OBJKTs, were able to find them, and reported that the system correctly classified.

Similarly, all three reported the successful classification of a code-based non-networked OBJKT.

As far as what features they would like to see implemented, the following were mentioned:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dark mode
    \item Making tags browsable (currently they are only text)
    \item Allow logging in with wallet, to visualise 'owner' specific versions of the artifacts
    \item Option to only run an artifact after checking its list of network calls (for security purposes)
    \item Only show "about page" as landing page the first time, then default to catalogue (using local storage)
    \item Show how many results a search returned
\end{itemize}

One participant also mentioned that snapshots need more explanation. "Is it just a image snapshot? Does it store the returned metadata by every query that the OBJKT does? Where are the snapshots stored? IPFS? How can I access them? How are snapshots triggered? Regularly for all tokens? Are they triggered differently for different tokens?" (Participant)

Another participant suggested that we replace the ``black'' thumbnails with actual thumbnails (potentially from snapshot screenshots).

One participant reported the Metadata URL not working. This is because it was using the \texttt{ipfs://} prefix. It has now been fixed.

Overall they found the design and functions user friendly. They could find their way easily.

``Nice and clean interface, not cluttered, intuitive UI and easy to use'' (Participant)

\subsection{Interviews}

The interviews were conducted in a semi-structured way, starting with a walkthrough of the artifact, and letting the participant explore the system.
Then a general discussion about code-based crypto art would take place, with the researcher sometimes nudging the participant with questions about the long-term preservation. 

In general the system was received with enthusiasm, with one participant highlighting how important it is that this artifact focuses on HEN artworks, because of its cultural significance.

One of the participants reiterated that snapshots need a bit more explaining, similarly to what had been mentioned by one of the evaluation form participants.

Another participant mentioned that they would like to see a space where manual documentation can be added, either by the artist or by conservators, or both. "We need a document" (Participant).

One of the questions asked was whether artists care about the type of restoration approaches. The participant believes that artists are generally more flexible about the types of intervention than conservators.

One of the participants explained that not every aspect of an artwork can be open source, and thus for long term preservation a ``conservation package'' should be prepared to share with a museum or another cultural institution.

An interesting topic of discussion was the need for a cross-platform standard for networked artworks. Allowing artworks to query certain kinds of data from its hosting platforms.

One participant reminded that artworks should always have a ``fall-back'' static version, if the network fails.

A participant expressed their wish for a hardware device that users can host at home for pinning their own collections.

The participants agreed that there is a need for a conversation between artists, conservators, and platforms, about the way best way forward for preservation.

On participant stated the importance for this work, because networked crypto art is ``the most native art form to the blockchain" (Participant).


\section{Data Volume Trend}

In this section we will extract and analyse data from the artifact, with the goal of gaining insights into the future storage requirements of \texttt{ARKIVO}.
Firstly we will look at the trend in terms of data stored over time.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{graph-arkivo-ipfs-time.png}
    \caption[IPFS Storage Over Time (Code-Based OBJKTs)]{IPFS Storage Over Time (Code-Based OBJKTs)}
    \label{fig:graph-ipfs-time}
\end{figure}


As can be seen in \autoref{fig:graph-ipfs-time}, there has been a significant slowing down of growth in terms of storage requirements, which is positive from a cost of storage perspective. Since \texttt{ARKIVO} does not store market data, it is impossible to determine how this compares to the slowing down in market activity.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph-net-vs-nonnet-tokens.png}
    \caption{Networked vs Non-Networked (Number of Tokens)}
    \label{fig:graph-net-nonnet}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph-net-vs-nonnet-size.png}
    \caption{Networked vs Non-Networked (Artifact Size)}
    \label{fig:graph-net-vs-nonnet-size}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Networked vs Non-Networked}
  \label{fig:net-vs-nonnet}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:net-vs-nonnet} reveals that networked OBJKTs constitute a minority in terms of number of tokens minted, with only 6.5\% of tokens, however that figure more than doubles if we analyse it from an artifact size perspective. This suggests that even though small in relative number, network OBJKTs are on average larger in size. It must be noted that there is a discrepancy between the total number of tokens shown in \autoref{fig:graph-net-nonnet} (16,652) and the total number of tokens originally reported in \autoref{sub:rq1_mile4} (\nameref{sub:rq1_mile4}, page \pageref{sub:rq1_mile4}), 21,394. This discrepancy is due to the fact that these graphs exclude burned OBJKTs, which are \texttt{4,742} in total.

This data shows that it is feasible for \texttt{ARKIVO} to continue running on its current infrastructure, especially if we are able to offload snapshots to home nodes.

\section{Archiving ARKIVO}

As discussed in \autoref{subsec:archiveorg}, page \pageref{subsec:archiveorg}, Teia's current UI prevents the WayBack Machine from successfully capturing the OBJKTs displayed on each page. By employing a simpler Web UI, \texttt{ARKIVO} allows such archiving. As an example we requested the capture of ``Generative Abstract Series 012'' by Yazid via the \texttt{ARKIVO} page, and the capture completed successfully, see \autoref{fig:awayback-arkivo}. This gives artworks catalogued by our system a chance of gaining yet another archival copy, and these copies could even outlast \texttt{ARKIVO} itself.

\section{Discussion}

The following sections will provide additional discussion of relevance to this project.

\subsection{Capturing Interactive Artworks}
\label{subsec:capture-interactive}

One of the challenges of automating the aesthetic capture of user-interactive artworks is determining the ways in which they can be interacted with. As discussed in \autoref{sec:interactivity}, interactions can take many forms. However a manual non-exhaustive sampling of OBJKTs indexed by \texttt{ARKIVO} suggests that mouse and keyboard interactions are the most common forms of interaction in this dataset. Tools like PlayWright can simulate mouse and keyboard input during the snapshotting process, so in theory it should be possible to capture this kind of interaction. However the biggest challenge in achieving automatic interaction without any prior knowledge of the artwork is determining where in the screen to click or which keys to press. Also depending on the nature of the artwork, the interactions could be quite complex.

However a very basic experiment was attempted, using ChatGPT, to determine if a piece is interactive, and if so, where in the screen to click. As an example, the ``Jumpy Dot'' artwork by mrdoob was used.

After uploading the screenshot, the following prompts, designed to be generic and applicable to all artworks indexed by \texttt{ARKIVO}, were used:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item examine this image, and tell me if you think this represents an interactive interface
	\item if I were to click on the image to interact with it, give me approximate x,y coordinates where I should click
\end{enumerate}


The full ChatGPT chat with prompts and responses can be found in Appendix 3, page \pageref{chap:chatgpt-mouse}.

ChatGPT successfully identified the 'start' button and thus correctly classified the artwork as interactive. It also provided the following \texttt{X,Y} coordinates for click it: \texttt{255, 350}

As can be seen in \autoref{fig:chat-gpt-click-guess}, the coordinate provided by ChatGPT was relatively close, but failed to hit the 'start' button.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{jumpydot.png}
    \caption{Input screenshot}

  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{jumpydot-click.png}
    \caption{ChatGPT coordinate guess}
    \label{fig:image2}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{ChatGPT estimated interaction coordinate}
  \label{fig:chat-gpt-click-guess}
\end{figure}

It should be noted that this artwork, due to the simplicity its the interface, and the explicit nature of the 'start' button, constitutes one of the easiest possible tests for an LLM like ChatGPT to determine interactivity and hotspot locations for interactions. The fact that it failed to provide the correct coordinate suggests there is still a gap between the textual description of the location of the button, "close to the center horizontally [...] slightly below the center vertically" and the prediction of the coordinate.

The LLM approach to UI interaction is fairly new, but some research is starting emerge \cite{liuMakeLLMTesting2024}, and more is expected to follow.

Alternative strategies for interacting with the artwork can also be experimented with. For example, the Android development ecosystem has a tool, UI/Application Exerciser Monkey, which generates pseudo-random streams of user events such as clicks, touches, or gestures for automated UI testing \cite{UIApplicationExerciser}.

\subsection{Cost of Storage}

Currently, the cost of minting an OBJKT on the HEN contract constitutes a fraction of the cost of hosting and/or pinning 2GB of data. This represents a loophole that could be exploited by malicious actors, or freeloaders, making the pinning of assets hosted by Teia unfeasible without a significant recurring investment, which impacts the economic sustainability of the project.

\subsection{Emulation}

As time passes, technology will continue to evolve. New hardware will run new operating systems, which will run new web browsers, or even totally paradigm changing \emph{content rendering applications} which may replace web browsers in the future. This means that in long term it seems inevitable that all code-base artworks created today, even those based on web standards and without any network dependencies, will require some form of hardware and/or browser emulation to render successfully. 

This inevitable evolution into emulated environments does represent an additional challenge for networked artworks, because in addition to emulating the artefact's code-base itself, the emulation environment must also simulate the network dependencies of the artwork, and this can pose a problem known to software developers as \emph{dependency hell}, where each dependency in turn depends on a number of other dependencies, leading to an ever increasing dependency tree. A solution to this problem seems unfeasible, if any of those dependencies, or their sub-dependencies, does not strictly follow the web3 architecture that makes projects easily duplicable.

For this reason, the IOC model gains an even greater importance for the longevity of code-based networked artworks, because you can more easily generate the data expected by the artwork, or in the worst-case scenario, simply repeatedly inject the last known good snapshot of data for all future renderings.

\subsection{Beyond the Canvas}

All of the artworks which this project currently aims to cater for in terms of conservation have one thing in common: their visual rendering is restricted to the boundaries of an HTML element on a web page, the canvas. Even those which intentionally choose to spread their visual expression past the boundaries of a single canvas element, are still constrained by the larger HTML DOM object or web page in which they, as web-based artworks, essentially exist. This is not unique to digital art. The great majority of paintings displayed in traditional museums are also constrained by their physical framed canvasses. Sculptures and other art installations are exceptions to this rule. However networked art reaches out into the world, and it would seem appropriate to explore a rendering medium that represents that breaking away from the canvas.


\subsection{Identifying IPFS Pinning Abuse}

Since most IPFS pinning services are paid for, there is a potential for abuse of free pinning services like Teia, and now Arkivo, by mining directory-x OBJKTs just as a way to store data on IPFS for free. The OBJKT might even render a piece of original art, but just as a facade for a much larger data payload. This would add to an archive's storage costs without contributing back in terms of donation, hurting its sustainability.


\section{Conclusion}

This chapter provided a detailed and systematic evaluation of the artifact from several angles, such as web performance, IPFS pinning validation and stakeholder feedback.
Several areas of improvement were identified, which will be addressed in future iterations of the project. The stakeholder feedback was particularly useful and encouraging as it validated the choice of topic of the study.
