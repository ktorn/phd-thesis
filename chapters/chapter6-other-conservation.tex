\subsection{Bootloader method}

A web3 approach is to load a lightweight bootloader OBJKT, which is able to contact the blockchain for the IPFS hash of the latest version of the artwork.

A networked OBJKT also starts with the same 3-step loading sequence as its non-networked variant, but it makes additional requests to load data from external data sources. See figure \ref{fig:objkt-loading-net}.

It is these additional network calls by the loaded OBJKT that can easily stop working, because unlike steps 1-3, which are controlled by the page UI and are therefore editable by the marketplace, the OBJKT payload is immutable from the moment of minting, and hence cannot accommodate any changes to any elements of these last requests, may they be in the URL, API changes, or any others.
