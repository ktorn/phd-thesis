This work would not have been possible without the assistance of a number of people. I would like to thank...


Having spent the first two decades of my life, dreaming about pursuing a career in the arts, life took me in a different direction, towards the field of computing and software development, a career path that I thoroughly enjoyed. Now that I find myself veering into a new career in Academia as a lecturer and researcher, I accidentally stumbled across the art world again. Within the crazy world of crypto and web3, I found an amazing cultural oasis within the Tezos art community. It is to this community that I also dedicate this thesis, for without them this would this work would not exist.
